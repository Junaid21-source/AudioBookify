# AudioBookify - Make your own audiobook now!

### AudioBookify is a robust platform for making your own audiobooks. This is the beta version. This app uses a text-to-speech engine to convert your text to audio so that you can hear your own writings based on your idea.

## What you can do with this app and how to use it:

#### If you open the app, you will see a text editor. In that text editor, you can write down your audiobook. That said, you can also select a PDF (Portable Document Format) or a TXT (Text file). It means that you can write down your book in a pdf or text file and then import it to our software. You can configure different things based on your preferences while making your own audiobook.


- You can change the gender’s voice which are male’s voice and female’s voice.

- You can change the file type. There are three audio type files - MP3, WAV and OGG.

- You can change the quality. There are three different qualities: Excellent quality, Medium quality, normal quality.

#### In the bottom right corner, you will see an export icon. Click that button which is to finish your audiobook and save it. After that, the software will process and save the audiobook as an audio file. The audiobook will be saved in the apps directory folder. It will be saved as “chosen_name.mp3/wav/ogg”. And then you can listen to your own made audiobook. If you want you can also use this app as a text-to-speech converter.
